cap theorem
- Any time system can be have only two of the three system properties consitency, availibility and partition theorem.
- applied on distributed system or database. if database has multiple nodes.
- Think to apply it at early stages of system design.
- If between 2 db nodes there is partition, then also if any query comes, we get respone. it means system is partition tolerant. Here afterwards we can only chose consistent or availablity not both.
