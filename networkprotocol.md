Network protocols:

client-server model 
- http
- ftp
- smtp
- websockets -> two way communication between client and server, for ex. if client1 wants to send message to client2, then client will send to server and than server will send to client2.

peer-2-peer model
- webRTC -> client1 can send message directly to client2.

ftp -> data is not encrpyted -> so we use https

Transport layer
- TCP -> ordering of message, ack  (ex. -> where we need to transfer all the data, world wide web) -> so it is slow as compared to upd which is not ordered and no ack. (ex. live streaming -> we can not go to previous)
